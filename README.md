#  YOKED Gym Website

A fully responsive, informative, and visually engaging gym website project built using **HTML** and **CSS**. This project was initially developed on **Glitch** and later migrated to **GitHub** for version control and portfolio deployment.

##  Live Pages

- **Home Page (`index.html`)** – Highlights the science-backed benefits of fitness and why staying active is essential for mental, physical, and emotional health.
- **Equipment Page (`equipment.html`)** – Lists and describes gym machines with detailed muscle targets, embedded video demos, and accompanying images.
- **Workouts Page (`workouts.html`)** – Explains types of workouts (strength, cardio, flexibility) in-depth, including physiological impacts and training benefits.
- **Contact Page (`contact.html`)** – Contains a clean form where users can reach out for gym advice, complete with validation patterns, a dropdown menu, and a submission redirect.

##  Features

-  Blue-themed design with styled header, nav, and sections
-  Responsive layout (using flexbox for nav and image alignment)
-  Image assets placed on the right of each text block for clarity
-  Embedded YouTube video links open in a new tab for exercise demos
-  Scientifically accurate content that explains the purpose and benefit of each exercise
-  Form validation using HTML5 attributes and pattern matching

##  Notes

- The project can be further enhanced with JavaScript for filtering workouts, dynamic form handling, and modal video previews.
- Additional responsiveness (via media queries) and accessibility features (like `aria-labels`) are recommended for future updates.
